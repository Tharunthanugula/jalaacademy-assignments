    "S103": "Rahul",
    "S104": "Sneha",

    "S103": {"name": "Rahul", "grade": "A+"}
}
print("\n1.4 Nested Dictionary of Students:")
print(nested_students)

print("\n1.5 Access name and grade of S102:")
print("Name:", nested_students["S102"]["name"])

 1.6 Print the keys present in the dictionary
print("\n1.6 Keys in main dictionary:")
